# RankBCA
In information retrieval, users need to find documents with high relevance from a huge number of documents on the basis of the input query. How to rank the documents according to relevance in the system and meet user needs become the import issues to be solved in information retrieval. The methods called learning to rank using machine learning techniques to generate ranking function automatically are applied extensively. A parallel B cell algorithm is proposed using clonal selection mechanism in biological immunity for reference and applied to learning to rank, thus an optimal ranking function can be determined. The novel algorithm is compared with traditional ones through experiment. The experimental result proves that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional ones in respect of accuracy, learning time and convergence rate and is able to determine an optimal ranking function, it is an effective learning to rank algorithm.
